It’s the mess of reality.\n- Theoretical Machine Learning: This is about math and abstraction and idealized scenarios and limits and beauty and informing what is possible. It is a whole lot neater and cleaner and removed from the mess of reality.\n\nThe best way for practice-focused methodology is something like ['practice — learning — practice'](http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-for-programmers/#comment-358985), that means where students first come with some existing projects with problems and solutions (practice) to get familiar with traditional methods in the area and perhaps also with their methodology. After practicing with some elementary experiences, they can go into the books and study the underlying theory, which serves to guide their future advanced practice and will enhance their toolbox of solving practical problems. Studying theory also further improves their understanding on the elementary experiences, and will help them acquire advanced experiences more quickly.\n\n It's a long plan. It may take an year. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.\n\n## Don't feel you aren't smart enough\n\n- [What if I’m Not Good at Mathematics](http://machinelearningmastery.com/what-if-im-not-good-at-mathematics/)\n- [5 Techniques To Understand Machine Learning Algorithms Without the Background in Mathematics](http://machinelearningmastery.com/techniques-to-understand-machine-learning-algorithms-without-the-background-in-mathematics/)\n- [How do I learn machine learning?](https://www.quora.com/Machine-Learning/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1)\n\n## About Video Resources\n\nSome videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class.
